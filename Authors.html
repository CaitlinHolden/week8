       <h3>S.J Sanders </h3> 
       <p>About:  LS.J. Sanders is a mom of two toddlers and one adult living in Anchorage, Alaska. She has a BA degree in History, but spends most of her free time painting, sculpting, doing odd bits of historical research, and writing. While she has more research orientated writing under another pen name, her passion is sci-fi and paranormal romance of which she is an avid reader. After years of tinkering with the idea, and making her own stories up in her head, S.J has began to seriously pursue writing as an author of Sci-fi Romance utilizing her interests in how cultures diversify and what they would look like on a extraterrestrial platform to humans interacting with them and finding love.</p>

     <h3>Ruby Dixon</h3>

     <h3>Honey Phillips</h3>
     <P>About:  Honey wrote and illustrated her first book at the tender age of 5. Her writing has improved since then. Her drawing skills, unfortunately, have not. She loves writing, reading, traveling, cooking, and drinking champagne - not necessarily in that order.

        Her steamy science fiction stories focus on hot alien warriors and the Earth women they canâ€™t resist. From abductions to invasions, the ride might be rough, but the end always satisfies.</P>
